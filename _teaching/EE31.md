EE31 is a semester long team project where students are expected to build a robot capable of color detection, wall sensing, wifi communication, and servo motion. It is an introduction to the engineering method: concept, planning and analysis, design, test. Students also gain experience in the use of microcontroller and peripherals, analog-to-digital converters, digital signal-processors, memory and computer aided design tools. Students are expected to provide schedules, schematics and specifications; build prototypes; present their projects orally; and deliver a working system.

**Terms:** Fall 2024

What I did as a TA:

* Guided students through the process of designing, building, and testing a robot to perform wall 
detection, color detection, line following, and server communication over WIFI 
* Conducted regular office hours to assist students with project planning, code debugging, and 
circuit troubleshooting. 
* Attended workshops and training sessions to stay current with best practices in teaching, 
learning, and lab safety
