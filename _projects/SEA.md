This project explores the sustainability of machine learning hardware for edge devices by comparing FPGA and ASIC-based accelerators. Using tools like ACT and GreenFPGA, the study analyzes both the embodied and operational carbon footprints of each approach while running image classification tasks on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The goal is to assess the trade-offs between energy efficiency, reusability, and overall environmental impact. Focus will be placed on developing optimized FPGA implementations, with the Coral USB ASIC accelerator used for comparison as time allows.

# üîç Project Overview:
This project investigates the sustainability of two hardware acceleration approaches‚ÄîFPGAs and ASICs‚Äîfor edge-based machine learning workloads. With machine learning becoming more common on low-power devices, it's crucial to understand the environmental trade-offs between reconfigurable and fixed-function hardware. The work is centered around quantifying both the embodied and operational carbon footprints of each platform.
