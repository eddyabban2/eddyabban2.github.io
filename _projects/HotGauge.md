During my undergraduate degree I was a research assistant on the [HotGauge](https://sites.tufts.edu/tcal/publications/hotgauge/) project which seeks to use performance, power, and thermal simulations to effectively simulate advanced hotspots on x86 microprocessors. I was specifically exploring the impacts of heatsinks from the [Diamond Foundry](https://www.df.com/) on performance. I also refactored project code and updated three simulators for compatibility with RedHat 8, ensuring seamless migration from RedHat 6. And wrote project documentation to streamline onboarding and increase usability.

I  presented my results at the Tufts Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Symposium.
