Hello! I'm a senior at Tufts University studying Computer Engineering. I am currently applying for PhD programs in Eletrical and Computer Engineering to do research in Computer Architecture. I am a research assistant in [Tufts Computer Architecture Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/tcal/) on the HotGauge Project under Professor [Mark Hempstead](https://sites.tufts.edu/tcal/people/prof-hempstead/) which focuses on developing a method for accurately simulating advanced hotspots on ARM microprocessors. 


The best way to contact me is through email: `edward.abban@tufts.edu`.
