Hello! I'm a senior at Tufts University and an Incoming PhD student at University of California, Santa Cruz in Computer Science and Engineering, under [Professor Dustin Richmond](https://www.dustinrichmond.com). I am currently a research assistant in [Tufts Computer Architecture Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/tcal/) on the HotGauge Project under [Professor Mark Hempstead](https://sites.tufts.edu/tcal/people/prof-hempstead/) which focuses on developing a method for accurately simulating advanced hotspots on ARM microprocessors. 

I am also doing some research for fun into the sustainability of using FPGAs for edge machine learning inference. 

The best way to contact me is through email: `abban16204@gmail.com` or `eabban@ucsc.edu`.
