Hello! I'm a PhD student in the [Hardware Systems Collective](https://hsc.ucsc.edu) at University California, Santa Cruz in Computer Science and Engineering, advised by [Professor Dustin Richmond](https://www.dustinrichmond.com). I am interested in researching Computer In Memory Accelerators for ternary machine learning models. My current project is implementing a Scalable MatMul-Free Large Language Model accelerator using ternary weights on an FPGA and GPU. In addition, I am also doing an in depth evaluation of the performance of Ternary Machine Learning Model performance on GPUs.

I received my bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Tufts University. During which, I was a research assistant in the [Tufts Computer Architecture Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/tcal/) on the HotGauge Project under [Professor Mark Hempstead](https://sites.tufts.edu/tcal/people/prof-hempstead/). My project  focused on accurately simulating the impacts of diamond heat sinks on the performance of Intel x86.

The best way to contact me is through email: `abban16204@gmail.com` or `eabban@ucsc.edu`.
